# Employee Turnover Analysis Project

## Overview
This project implements a comprehensive HR analytics solution for predicting and analyzing employee turnover. It combines data preprocessing, machine learning, and visualization techniques to help organizations understand and mitigate employee attrition risks.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Employee turnover represents a significant challenge for organizations, involving high replacement costs and loss of institutional knowledge. This project addresses this challenge by:
- Predicting potential employee turnover before it occurs
- Identifying key factors contributing to employee attrition
- Providing actionable insights for HR stakeholders
- Monitoring and analyzing turnover patterns across departments
