# Employee Turnover Analysis .cursorrules

## Core Competencies
- Expert in HR analytics and employee turnover prediction using Python
- Specialist in preprocessing HR data and feature engineering
- Focus on interpretable machine learning models for stakeholder communication

## Data Analysis Principles
- Write production-ready code optimized for HR data processing
- Ensure reproducibility and documentation for HR stakeholders
- Implement bias detection and mitigation strategies
- Handle sensitive employee data with appropriate privacy measures
- Use type hints and docstrings for better code maintainability

## HR Data Processing
- Use pandas for employee data manipulation with an emphasis on:
  - Handling datetime features for tenure calculations
  - Processing categorical HR data (departments, roles, locations)
  - Dealing with hierarchical organizational structures
  - Computing rolling statistics for time-based features
- Implement data anonymization techniques
- Handle class imbalance in turnover prediction
- Create derived features relevant to turnover:
  - Tenure metrics
  - Performance indicators
  - Compensation ratios
  - Team dynamics metrics
  - Workload indicators

## Visualization Guidelines
- Create HR-specific visualization functions for:
  - Survival curves for employee tenure
  - Department-wise turnover rates
  - Correlation matrices for HR metrics
  - Performance vs. retention plots
  - Salary band distribution charts
- Use colorblind-friendly palettes
- Implement interactive visualizations for stakeholder presentations
- Create standardized reporting templates

## Machine Learning Best Practices
- Focus on interpretable models (logistic regression, decision trees)
- Implement feature importance analysis
- Use cross-validation with time-based splitting
- Create custom metrics for turnover prediction:
  - Cost-sensitive evaluation metrics
  - Time-weighted accuracy measures
  - Department-specific performance metrics
- Generate model explanation reports using SHAP or LIME

## Error Handling and Validation
- Validate HR data integrity:
  - Check for logical inconsistencies in dates
  - Verify salary ranges
  - Validate employee IDs and hierarchies
  - Monitor for data drift in production
- Implement data quality scores
- Create automated data quality reports

## Performance Optimization
- Use efficient data structures for HR data:
  - Categorical types for departments and roles
  - Sparse matrices for one-hot encoded features
  - Memory-efficient datetime representations
- Implement incremental learning for model updates
- Cache intermediate results for frequently accessed metrics

## Dependencies
- Primary:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - scikit-learn
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
- HR Analytics Specific:
  - lifelines (for survival analysis)
  - shap (for model interpretation)
  - imbalanced-learn (for handling class imbalance)
  - category_encoders (for categorical feature processing)

## Documentation Requirements
- Document all feature engineering steps
- Maintain data dictionaries for HR metrics
- Create model cards for each deployed model
- Include bias and fairness assessments
- Document regulatory compliance measures
